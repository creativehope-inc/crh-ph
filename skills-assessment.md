# Web Development Skills Assessment

This is a breakdown of web development skills for you to gain understanding of your current skill set. Please answer honestly as possible.

Note that knowledge for each level is cumulative; being at level 3 implies that you know everything from the levels 0-2.

## Programming

| Systems decompositon | Not able to think above the level of a single file/class | Able to break up a problem space and design solution as long as it is within the same platform/technology | Able to design systems that span multiple technologies/platforms | Able to visualize and design complex systems with multiple product lines and integrations with external systems. |
| Communication | Cannot express thoughts/ideas to peers. Poor spelling and grammar. | Peers can understand what is being said. Good spelling and grammar. | Is able to effectively communicate with peers | Able to understand and communicate thoughts/design/ideas/specs in a unambiguous manner and adjusts communication as per the context |
| Code organization within a file | No evidence of organization within a file | Methods are grouped logically or by accessibility | Code is grouped into regions and well commented with references to other source files | File has a header, summary, well commented, and consistent with white space usage. The file should look beautiful. |
| Code readability | Mono-syllable names | Good names for files, variables, classes, methods | No long functions, comments explaining unusual code, bug fixes, code assumptions | Code flows naturally - no deep nesting of conditionals or methods |
| Defensive coding |  Doesn't understand the concept | Checks all arguments and asserts critical assumptions in code | Makes sure to check return values and check for exceptions around code that can fail. | Can detect failure points even in code that he/she is not the main author. Writes tests to cover potential failure points |
| Error handling | Only codes the happy case | Basic error handling around code that can throw exceptions/generate errors | Ensures that error/exceptions leave program in good state, resources, connections all cleaned up properly |	Codes to detect possible exception before, maintain consistent exception handling strategy in all layers of code, come up with guidelines on exception handling for entire system. |
| Requirements | 	Takes the given requirements and codes to spec | Come up with questions regarding missed cases in the spec | Understand complete picture and come up with entire areas that need to be speced | Able to suggest better alternatives and flows to given requirements based on experience |

| API | Needs to look up the documentation frequently | Has the most frequently used APIs in memory | Vast and in-depth knowledge of the used API | Has written libraries that sit on top of the API to simplify frequently used tasks and to fill in gaps in the API |
| Frameworks | Has not used any framework outside of the core language | Has heard about but not used the popular frameworks available for the language | Has used more than one framework in a professional capacity and is well-versed with the idioms of the frameworks | Has authored a framework |
| Scripting | No knowledge of scripting tools | Batch files/shell scripts | Perl/Python/Ruby/VBScript/Powershell | Has written and published reusable code | 

## Industry Knowledge

| Topic | Level 0 | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Coding paradigms exposed to | Imperative / Procedural | Object Oriented | Declarative, understand static vs dynamic typing, weak vs strong typing and static inferred types | Functional, understands lazy evaluation, currying, continuations |
| Upcoming technologies | Has not heard of the upcoming technologies | Has heard of upcoming technologies in the field | Read some articles/manuals/documentations | Has played with the previews and has actually built something with it |
| Skills improvement | Does not read books/subscribe to blogs/attend courses | Reads books/subscribes to blogs/attends courses | Maintains a link blog/repo/notebook with some collection of useful articles and tools that he/she has collected | Maintains a blog in which personal insights and thoughts on programming are shared |
